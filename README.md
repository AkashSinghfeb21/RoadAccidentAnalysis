## 🪜 Milestones & Weekly Breakdown

### **Milestone 1 – Dataset Acquisition & Data Cleaning**
**Week 1: Project Initialization and Dataset Acquisition**
- Define project objectives and expected outcomes.  
- Download the US Accidents dataset.  
- Explore structure, shape, and schema of the dataset.  
- Check for missing data, data types, and basic statistics.  

**Week 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Drop or impute columns with excessive missing values.  
- Convert datetime columns to proper formats.  
- Create new time-based features (Hour, Weekday, Month).  
- Encode categorical variables if needed.  
- Handle outliers and duplicates.  

---

### **Milestone 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Week 3: Univariate Analysis**
- Analyze distribution of accident severity levels.  
- Plot accident frequency by time of day, day, and month.  
- Examine weather and road types using histograms, bar charts, and pie charts.  

**Week 4: Bivariate / Multivariate Analysis**
- Study correlations between severity and factors like weather, visibility, and road surface condition.  
- Use heatmaps, boxplots, and pair plots to show relationships.  

---

### **Milestone 3 – Geospatial & Insight Extraction**
**Week 5: Geospatial and Location-Based Analysis**
- Visualize accident hotspots using latitude and longitude.  
- Create scatter or density maps by states and cities.  
- Identify top 5 most accident-prone regions.  

**Week 6: Insight Extraction and Hypothesis Testing**
- Answer key analytical questions:  
  - What time of day has the most accidents?  
  - Are accidents more severe during rain or fog?  
  - Is there a link between visibility and severity?  
- Document assumptions, test hypotheses, and summarize findings.  

---

### **Milestone 4 – Visualization, Interpretation & Reporting**
**Week 7: Final Visualization and Interpretation**
- Combine findings into clear summaries with visuals.  
- Focus on storytelling and readability.  
- Finalize graphs, dashboards, and interpretations.  

**Week 8: Documentation and Presentation**
